! $ xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap

! Following are my settings for the Stupid Apple Keyboard
! Map the Eject key to Delete Key
keycode 169 = Delete

! Change left Alt key to Command
clear mod4
keycode  64 = Super_L

! Change left Command key to Alt
clear mod3
keycode 133 = Alt_L

! ToDO: The Alt key is now recognized as both Alt and Super. Find a way to fix it later.
