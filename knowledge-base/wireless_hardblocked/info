Void doesn't come pre-installed with RFkill, so install that first:
# xbps-install rfkill

The problematic module is ath5k. We need to stop it start it again:
# modprobe -rfv ath5k 
# rfkill unblock all
# modprobe -v ath5k 

To prevent having to do this on every boot, simply disable module wmi from loading at boot:
# cd /etc/modprobe.d/
# touch ./blacklist.conf
# echo "blacklist wmi" >> ./blacklist.conf

Now final step to cement the changes is to add following lines to foot of "/etc/rc.local"
rfkill unblock all
exit 0


Tip:
With later verision of linux or you getting a new laptop, the name of the module may change from ath5k to ath9k (or something else).
To find out the exact name do:
$ lsmod | grep ath
