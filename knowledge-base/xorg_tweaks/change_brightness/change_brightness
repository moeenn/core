If xbacklight returns following error:
"No output devices have backlight properties"

Note: Do ensure that the folder intel_backlight actually exists. If it doesn't this solution won't work

Add following to /etx/X11/

Section "Device"
        Identifier      "Card0"
        Driver          "intel"
        Option          "Backlight"     "/sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight"
EndSection
